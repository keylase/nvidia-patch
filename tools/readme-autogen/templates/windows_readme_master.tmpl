NVENC and NvFBC patches for Windows Nvidia drivers
==================================================

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/keylase/nvidia-patch.svg) ![Latest GeForce version](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest%20GeForce%20version-${latest_geforce_version}-brightgreen.svg) ![Latest Quadro version](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest%20Quadro%20version-${latest_quadro_version}-blue.svg)

NVENC patch removes restriction on maximum number of simultaneous NVENC video encoding sessions imposed by Nvidia to consumer-grade GPUs.

NvFBC patch (wrapper) allows to use NvFBC on consumer-grade GPUs. See [**nvfbcwrp** (clickable)](nvfbcwrp) directory for details.

  - Windows 10
  - Windows 11
  - Windows Server 2008 R2
  - Windows Server 2012
  - Windows Server 2012 R2
  - Windows Server 2016

- Nvidia driver. Patch available for versions in [table below](#version-table).

## NVENC Patch Step-by-Step Guide

1. Download and install the latest Nvidia driver supported by this patch.
2. Download the latest patching tool:
   - You can use the updated fork of the Win\_1337\_Apply\_Patch tool from [Win\_1337\_Apply\_Patch](https://github.com/ramhaidar/Win_1337_Apply_Patch/releases/latest) \([pCloud Mirror](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=KS2rtalK)\).
   - Alternatively, you can use the PowerShell script version available at [Win\_1337\_Apply\_Patch\_Powershell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramhaidar/Win_1337_Apply_Patch_Powershell/refs/heads/main/Win_1337_Apply.ps1) \([pCloud Mirror](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=B62)\). For instructions on how to use it, see the [README.md](https://github.com/ramhaidar/Win_1337_Apply_Patch_Powershell/blob/main/README.md) file.
3. Save patch(es) corresponding to your system, driver and product version from [Version Table](#version-table) using direct link to the patch (Right Click -> "Save as\.\.\.")
   - *Alternatively you may checkout repo using git or download it as ZIP archive and then locate corresponding .1337 patch file in `win` directory.*
4. Apply x64 library patch to corresponding file in `%WINDIR%\system32\` with the Win\_1337\_Apply\_Patch tool.
   - *If patching fails, close all applications using nvencodeapi64.dll, such as OBS Studio, Plex or Discord.*
5. Apply x86 library patch to corresponding file in `%WINDIR%\SysWOW64\` in the same way as previous one.
   - *If patching fails, close all applications using nvencodeapi.dll, such as OBS Studio, Plex or Discord.*

**Example:** for 64bit Windows 10 running driver version $latest_geforce_version, use `win10_x64/$latest_geforce_version/nvencodeapi64.1337` against `C:\WINDOWS\system32\nvencodeapi64.dll` **and** `win10_x64/$latest_geforce_version/nvencodeapi.1337` against `C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\nvencodeapi.dll`.

If you still get "problem occured when patching" error, refer to the [instructions to change the ownership of the DLLs](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch/issues/795#issuecomment-2225573296) by @VorlonCD

You can also use FFmpeg to [verify that NVENC session limit is removed](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch/wiki/Verify-NVENC-patch).

If you experience issues with streaming software based on Nvidia streaming facilities (Nvidia Shield TV, Moonlight), you also have to import few registry values in order to workaround binary signature mismatch. See [**skip\_sig\_check** (clickable)](skip_sig_check) directory for instructions.
